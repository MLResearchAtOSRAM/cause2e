discovery.py
================================================================
This module implements the StructureLearner class.

It is used to learn a causal graph from domain knowledge and data.
The proposed procedure is as follows:\n
1) Read the data from a csv or parquet file.\n
2) Preprocess the data (e.g. delete or recombine variables).\n
3) Pass the domain knowledge.\n
4) Run a causal discovery algorithm.\n
5) Check if the graph looks sensible and orient remaining undirected or misdirected edges.\n
6) Check if the graph is a DAG conforming to the domain knowledge.\n
7) Save the graph in various file formats.\n
