    "# Structure learning with cause2e\r\n",
    "This notebook shows how ```cause2e``` can be used for learning causal graphs. Structure learning (also called causal discovery) can be performed by the ```discovery.StructureLearner``` after reading data and specifying domain knowledge. If we only want to perform a quick exploratory search, we can use the provided reasonable default parameters for the search procedure. However, if we need to finetune the settings for the causal search after encountering problems with the default option, this notebooks shows how to do it. The search is mostly based on the ```py-causal``` package, a wrapper around the well-known JAVA ```TETRAD``` software. ```Cause2e``` aims to use ```py-causal``` algorithms only for the search itself, in order to spare the user from dealing with JAVA error messages when dealing with peripheral tasks."

If we want to perform the analysis in a directory ```'dirname'``` that contains ```'dirname/data'``` and ```'dirname/output'``` as subdirectories, we can also use ```PathManagerQuick``` for an even easier setup. The experiment name is used for generating output files with meaningful names, in case we want to study multiple scenarios (e.g. with varying model parameters).
